# Node Definitions
# ----------------------------------------
# Define each node by giving it a name and (x, y) position for graphical representation.

node A  100  200  # Top-left node connected to power source
node B  300  200  # Top-right node connected to a wire and capacitor
node C  300  300  # Mid-right node connected to inductor and capacitor
node D  100  300  # Mid-left node connected to capacitor and wire
node E  200  200  # Center-top node connected to resistor and inductor
node F  200  300  # Center-bottom node connected to resistor and wire

# ----------------------------------------
# Component Definitions
# ----------------------------------------
# Define the electrical components and their connections between the nodes.
# Format: [component type] [start node] [end node] [value (if applicable)]

voltageSource A D 12    # DC voltage source from A to D with 12V
wire         E B        # Ideal wire connecting node E to B (top right connection)
wire         C F        # Ideal wire connecting node C to F (bottom right connection)
resistor     E F 100    # Resistor of 100 ohms between E and F (vertical center)
capacitor    B C 0.01   # Capacitor of 0.01 F between B and C (top right to mid right)
inductor     A E 0.5    # Inductor of 0.5 H between A and E (top left to center top)
wire         D F        # Ideal wire connecting node D to F (bottom left connection)
